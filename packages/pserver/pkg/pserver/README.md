### Protocol Buffer Deltas Server

pserver is a reference server implementation designed to run on Google App Engine using Firestore
as the persistence layer. It's designed to be as simple as possible but extensible. See 
[groupshare](https://github.com/dave/groupshare) for an example of how to extend pserver.
