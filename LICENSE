In the past I've licensed my work with permissive open source licenses. I've been
happy contributing to the open source ecosystem, and I've been happy to not derive
any of my income from this work.

However 2020 has been a terrible year for me financially, and I've lost all of my
income because of covid. I'm now focused on creating myself a new income stream.Â 

I'm developing the protod library for some commercial apps I have planned.

I'm still deciding how I'll license the protod library. If you have any suggestions
for how I can share my work while still deriving some income, please contact me on
dave@brophy.uk.
